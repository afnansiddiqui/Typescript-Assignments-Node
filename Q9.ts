// storing my favourite number in a variable looks easy like the one storing name in a variable
// I'll be storing 4 as my favourite number because it's my mother's birthday


let IdealNumber: number = 4;

let message: string = `My Ideal number or My Favourite Number is ${IdealNumber}`;
console.log(message);
